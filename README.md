<h2 align = "left" >About:</h2></h2>
<p>A small project/exercise I have been working on as a part of one of my course assignment.
The overall goal of this exercise is to get some hands-on experience with building a machine learning model on a real-world task. The task is to implement an improved version of the Naive Bayes algorithm that is able to predict the category of points of interest - one of "Restaurants", "Shopping" and "Nightlife"- from the Yelp Dataset and subsequently, 
apply the implementation on atest with no class label and hand in the predictions of the model. 
A competition hosted on <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/2024-cs762-point-of-interest-categorization/overview">Kaggle</a> provides a system 
that evaluates the results with the ground-truth and report the accuracy of the implementation</p>


<h2 align = "left"> The Competition:</h2>
<p> I tried to build Naive Bayes classifiers which is better than the benchwork method "Baseline - Review Only" listed on the leaderboard.
  The benchmark method is a standard version of Naive Bayes.
